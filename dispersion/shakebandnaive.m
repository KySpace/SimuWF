% This function naively couples 3 bands, located at 0, Â± 1 order
% with a band shift from the second to the first band
% all couples are with the same coefficient, which is impractical
function [b_bi, b_fl] = shakebandnaive(v, omg, K, k)
arguments
    v           % coupling coefficient
    omg         % band shift
    K           % shift in k vector to create multiple bands
    k           % k vector
